# High-Traffic Ticketing System Design with Caching Strategy

A ticketing system for a high-traffic event platform has to handle thousands of concurrent users buying tickets. To ensure scalability, fault tolerance, and high availability, the system can leverage cloud services and distributed caching.

### Key Elements

##### Frontend
- A React-based Single Page Application (SPA) hosted on Azure Static Web Apps for scalability and global distribution.
- Communicates with backend APIs for ticket purchasing and event data.
##### Backend
- Built with ASP.NET Core, hosted on Azure App Service.
- Implements RESTful APIs for ticket purchasing, event management, and user authentication.
- Uses Azure API Management for rate limiting and security.
##### Database
 - Azure SQL Database for transactional data (e.g., user accounts, ticket purchases).
 - Azure Cosmos DB for event metadata and high-speed reads. 
##### Caching
- Azure Cache for Redis to reduce database load and improve response times.
- Caches frequently accessed data like event details, ticket availability, and user session data.
##### Queueing
- Azure Service Bus for processing ticket purchases asynchronously to handle spikes in traffic.
##### Load Balancer
- Azure Front Door for global load balancing and DDoS protection.
##### Monitoring
- Azure Monitor and Application Insights for real-time monitoring and troubleshooting.
